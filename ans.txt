1) with the current definiton of the table we have two diffrent id colums
witch for now are redandent.
Another problem is the fact we have a repeting group (aka the purcesees)
stored in a singel colum and thus makes it vary hard to query.

2)
	We can have duplicate customerId's  because it is not the primery key.
3)
--create
	CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXSIST PURCHESES(customerId INTEGER PRIMERY KEY,
name TEXT NOT NULL, itemName TEXT NOT NULL PRIMERY KEY ,
	quantity INTEGER)

--insert
	INSERT INTO PURCHESES VALUES (123, "daniel", "avocado", 2);

4)
	The table comprimized the law that  "repeating groups are not
permittrd".
